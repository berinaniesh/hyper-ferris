# hyper-ferris
A humble attempt to make "Ferris the Crab" play chess

Hyper Ferris is a UCI chess engine written in rust. 

Hyper Ferris is WIP. No ETA. 

We stand on the shoulders of giants (And that's how GM Ben Finegold changes light bulbs!)

Hyper Ferris takes a lot of code and ideas from the chess programming wiki (https://www.chessprogramming.org/), Maksim Krozh's chess engine BBC (https://github.com/maksimKorzh/bbc), his youtube videos (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB9-prLkPwgvlKKqDgXhsMQ), Marcel Vanthoor's chess engine rustic (https://github.com/mvanthoor/rustic) and many other open source engines available out there. Goes without saying, I am extremely thankful to each one of them, especially Maksim Krozh. I am also thankful to the people over the rust discord server and talkchess.
